# Client app (Svelte frontend)

## Contents
 - The `public` directory contains all assets that are accessible to the end user/client. This includes static html, universal style files, supporting images, etc.
   - The `public/build` sub-directory includes the compiled output JavaScript and other resources produced by Svelte.
   - `public/index.html` is the placeholder for the main index page. Changes made here _will_ show up in the ultimately served application, but it is much better to make changes within the Svelte framework under `src`.
 - The `src` directory includes the Svelte components that form the bulk of the client app design and functionality. **Look in this directory for the "meat" of the app to make changes.**
   - `src/main.js` is just the basic wrapper that calls the client app. It is best to not touch this unless much more complexity and compartamentalization logic is needed.
   - `src/App.svelte` is the primary application code assembled as a Svelte module -- HTML, JavaScript interactive components, and CSS styling.

## Making changes
Svelte is a complied language, with the output being "vanilla" JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. After making a modification to anything in the `src` directory, you will need to re-build by running the following commmand from the command line _within this directory_.

> ```npm run build```

If you are only testing changes to the client, and aren't dependent on or modifying any logic within the Flask server (which as of this writing, amounts to very little), then you can more easily run in `dev` mode, which will auto-build whenever an underlying file is changed and saved, while also running a test deployment server without the need for `Flask` at all. To do so, use:

> ```npm run dev```

(This assumes npm and Svelte are both installed. Details on that to come.)

## Key dependencies
 - The ["xlsx" library here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xlsx), courtesy of the SheetJS community, is the main pillar for initially parsing in the input Excel file to a JavaScript Array of Arrays that can then be manipulated using vanilla JavaScript logic. (Or, if needed in the future, some other JavaScript library/structure that is more suited to tabular data structures, a la Python's `pandas` or R's dataframes.)
